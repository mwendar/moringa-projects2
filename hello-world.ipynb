 Resource: Cheat Sheet - Git Commands
Daily Git Workflow
Set Name and Email
Solo Programming
Use the git config command to set your name and email for your local computer. This only needs to be done once.

$ git config --global user.name "Santa Claus"
$ git config --global user.email santa@northpole.com

Tracking Changes
Create a new project directory with Git repository
In the terminal type these commands:

$ mkdir project-name
$ cd project-name
$ git init

After adding files or making changes, track the changes.
Use this command to add all changes:

$ git add .

Use this command to add a specific file (replace filename.ipynb with the name of the file to add):

$ git add filename.ipynb

Commit the changes.
In terminal:

$ git commit -m "add a short, descriptive present-tense message here describing the changes made"

Create repository for project on GitHub at https://github.com/new (Links to an external site.).

Add the remote to the project.

In terminal:

$ git remote add [remote name] [remote URL]

[remote name]: Name of the remote. When working solo, use origin.
[remote URL]: The URL of the remote on GitHub.
For example, this command adds a remote named origin to the repository at https://github.com/moringaschool/hello-world:
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/moringaschool/hello-world.git

Push the changes to GitHub.
In terminal:

$ git push [remote name] [branch name]

[branch name]: Name of the branch you're working on.
For example, this command pushes to the remote named origin to the master branch:
$ git push origin master

Clone repository from GitHub.
In terminal:

$ git clone [remote URL]

For example, this command clones the repository at https://github.com/moringaschool/hello-world:

$ git clone https://github.com/moringaschool/hello-world.git
